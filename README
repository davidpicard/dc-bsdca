DC-BSDCA stands for divide and conquer for budget stochastic dual coordinate ascend.

This code allows to train a kernel SVM extremely fast while being on a budget constraint. Maybe you'll find it usefull.

All the code is 3-clause BSD.

Compiling require jkernelmachines, but is easy done using maven. Simply type ``mvn install'' in dc-bsdca directory to generate the jar files in your own m2 repository.
